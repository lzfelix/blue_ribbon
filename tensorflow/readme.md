#Tensorflow implementations

My opinionated implementation of Tensorflow tutorials. Most differences consist on code organisation or comments on sections that I've found obscure while reading the original tutorials.

## TODO:
- add regularisation on the multilayer_network.
- make the network depth another hyperparameter.
- update where the text files are stored for word2vec implementation.
